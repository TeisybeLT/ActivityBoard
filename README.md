# Activity board for toddlers

This is a repository containing schematics and firmware files for the activity board that I built for my kiddo. I tried my best to design each specific component of this board to be low-stimulation and contain as few flashing lights as possible.

In this repo you will find:

* 555 timer-based door buzzer
* 555 timer based Ataripunk console
* Two variations of CD4017 based Larson scanners
* Simple light switch controlled LEDs
* A radio faceplate running some simple games

Everything was built using common off-the-shelf components and stuff you can find in any self-respecting junk box.Feel free to use this as inspiration for your own activity board.

KiCad was used to design the schematics. Radio faceplate firmware uses an Atmega 328P.
